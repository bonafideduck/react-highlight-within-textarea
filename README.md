[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-highlight-within-textarea.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-highlight-within-textarea) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com) ![Yarn Test](https://github.com/bonafideduck/react-highlight-within-textarea/workflows/Yarn%20Test/badge.svg)


## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-highlight-within-textarea
```
```
yarn add react-highlight-within-textarea
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useState } from 'react';
import { HighlightWithinTextarea } from 'react-highlight-within-textarea'

const Example = () => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("X Y Z and then XYZ");
  const onChange = (value) => setValue(value);
  return (
    <HighlightWithinTextarea
      value={value}
      highlight={/[XYZ]/g}
      onChange= {onChange}
    />
  );
};
```

The highlight property accepts several different types of values to describe 
what will be highlighted.  You can see the various ways to highlight things, 
along with example code, on the 
[documentation and demo page](https://bonafideduck.github.io/react-highlight-within-textarea/).

## Properties

value, onChange, ref, placeholder, highlight, selection

**value**: This can either be the text value or a DraftJs [EditorState](https://draftjs.org/docs/api-reference-editor-state/#internaldocs-banner).

**onChange**: This is called whenever the text value or selection changes.  You must update value to accept this change.  You only have to set the selection property if you want to change the current selection.

**ref**: Standard React ref.

**placeholder**: The placeholder text to print when no value is set.

**highlight**: This specifies what to highlght.  For more info, see the
[demo page](https://bonafideduck.github.io/react-highlight-within-textarea/).

**selection**: A selection containing `anchor` and `focus` that can be use to place the cursor or set selections.

## Known and Potential Issues

The following have not yet been verified to work or have issues.

* Form submit might not work.  To be honest, I don't even know how React works with form submit buttons.
* Accessible Rich Internet Applications [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) may not be supported.
* Reference forwarding probably works, but it hasn't been tested.
* Tab between form elements may not work. I haven't looked into this at all.
